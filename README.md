# Face Recognition Project

This project implements a real-time face recognition system using a pre-trained model created with Google Teachable Machine, integrated with TensorFlow and OpenCV for live webcam input. The model predicts the identity of a person in the webcam feed and outputs the confidence score of the prediction.

## **About the Model**

The face recognition model (keras.h5) was trained using Google Teachable Machine, a user-friendly platform for creating machine learning models without deep technical expertise. Hereâ€™s how the model was created and used:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Images of 2 individuals  were captured and uploaded to Google Teachable Machine.
   - Each class corresponds to a unique individual category.

2. **Training**:
   - The model was trained to classify images into 2 categories:
     - Individual 1
     - Individual 2
   - The training process used a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for feature extraction and classification.
     

3. **Output**:
   - The trained model was exported as `keras.h5`, a Keras-compatible file format.
   - Labels for the categories were saved in `labels.txt`.

## **Features**
- **Real-Time Face Recognition**: Identifies faces captured through a webcam.
- **Confidence Score**: Displays the confidence percentage of the prediction for each class.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed to be accessible for beginners in machine learning and computer vision.


## **How It Works**

1. **Input Data**:
   - Captures live webcam frames using **OpenCV**.
   - Each frame is resized to `224x224` pixels to match the input dimensions of the model.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - The image is normalized to a range of `[-1, 1]` for compatibility with the trained model.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The preprocessed image is passed to the TensorFlow model.
   - The model predicts the class (identity) with the highest confidence score.

4. **Output**:
   - The predicted class and confidence score are displayed on the console.
   - The live webcam feed is displayed in a separate window.

**Technical Requirements**

 **Dependencies**
 
- **TensorFlow**: For loading and using the pre-trained model.
- **OpenCV**: For capturing webcam images in real time.
- **NumPy**: For handling image data as arrays.
